# Three.js DNA Helix Experiment

This is a separate experiment folder for trying out Three.js DNA helix visualization.

## Features
- Realistic DNA double helix structure
- Purple-Blue color scheme
- Rotating animation
- Mouse interaction (move mouse to tilt the helix)
- Glowing effect
- Smooth shading and lighting

## How to Run

Simply open `index.html` in your browser. The Three.js library is loaded from CDN, so no installation is needed.

## Files
- `index.html` - Main HTML file with container and styles
- `dna-helix.js` - Three.js implementation of DNA helix
- `README.md` - This file

## Note
This folder is completely separate from the main NOX Biotech project and won't affect any existing code.
